    "# Apple and Google NLP Twitter Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "## Business Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter serve as an invaluable source of public sentiment and opinion. Understanding the sentiments of users on these platforms can provide valuable insights for businesses. In this project, the aim is to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze Twitter sentiment about products from two tech giants, Apple and Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "Apple and Google are two of the most prominent companies in the tech industry, producing a wide range of products that have a significant impact on people's lives. Monitoring the sentiment expressed by Twitter users towards these companies and their products can help businesses make informed decisions. This sentiment analysis can inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "The primary business problem that will be addressed is the need for a systematic and automated way to gauge the sentiment of tweets related to Apple and Google products. Twitter is a platform where millions of users express their opinions and experiences daily. Manual analysis of these tweets is not feasible due to the sheer volume of data. Therefore, there's need for a reliable NLP model that can classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Objective\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to build a proof-of-concept NLP model that can accurately rate the sentiment of tweets about Apple and Google products. This model will enable businesses to gain real-time insights into how their products are perceived by the Twitter community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific Objectives\n",
    "* **Data Collection:** A dataset of tweets related to Apple and Google products will be gathered. This dataset should include tweets that express both positive and negative sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to prepare it for NLP analysis. This includes tasks like text normalization, tokenization, and handling of missing or irrelevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Development:** Developing a baseline NLP model for binary sentiment classification, categorizing tweets as either positive or negative. This model will serve as a starting point for further improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the binary sentiment classifier using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This will help assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiclass Classification:** Extending the binary classifier to a multiclass classifier by incorporating a neutral sentiment category. This will provide a more nuanced understanding of sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Business Insights:** Interpret the results and provide actionable insights to businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project aims to create a valuable tool for businesses in the tech industry by leveraging NLP to understand and react to public sentiment on Twitter. By achieving the specific objectives outlined, the project will provide a scalable solution for sentiment analysis that can be adapted to other products and industries, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics of Success\n",
    "After modeling, the success metrics for the sentiment analysis on this project includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy:** Measure the accuracy of the sentiment classification model in correctly categorizing tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This metric indicates the model's ability to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:** Calculate precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance in correctly identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to balance precision (correctly identifying positive/negative sentiments) and recall (identifying all positive/negative sentiments).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "The data was sourced from [here](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions). Contributors evaluated tweets about multiple brands and products. The crowd was asked if the tweet expressed positive, negative, or no emotion towards a brand and/or product. If some emotion was expressed they were also asked to say which brand or product was the target of that emotion.\n",
